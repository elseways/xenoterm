Screen
-- 80x25 character cells
-- 8x16 pixels per cell = 640x400 total resolution
-- use CSS media queries to scale appropriately by multiples of 640 (integer scaling -only-)
-- bg/fg selected from 256-color palette (the standard "web safe" colors)
-- "chunk mode" graphics made of 2x4 4x4 pixel squares per cell (e.g. a 16x16 image is an 8x4 rectangle of cells)

Character set
-- ASCII and then some
-- use the existing 8x12 emoji
---- add support for palette-swapping for custom colors

Pieces

Client
-- React-based
-- with no logged-in user, presents a login page (still via the screen interface)
-- entirely keyboard-driven (and maybe gamepad - this API does exist!)

Client-Server API
-- read a page: GET /page?owner=<owner ?? self>&path=[<folder>/]<name>
-- write a page: POST /page/[<folder>]
-- stuff for messaging (realtime?)
-- what else?

Server
-- handles reading/writing pages from the central storage DB
-- handles messaging
-- what else?

DB
-- no need for anything fancy, just a simple key/value store
-- user profiles by userID
-- user page spaces by ID (map of page names to page data)
-- auth stuff
